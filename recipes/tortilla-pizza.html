    <img src="tortilla-pizza.png" alt="Tortilla Pizza">
    <p>This tortilla pizza is extremely easy to make.<br>
        It is light enough to be a snack, serves well as an appetizer,<br> 
        or is so good that it can be devoured alone! You can use any sort of topping variation.<br>
        The one below is the classic way I usually prepare it but feel free to experiment.<br>
    </p>
